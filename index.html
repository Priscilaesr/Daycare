                Each child who comes to Tiny Bear family with an unique personality. Their interests, inclination, feelings and perceptions grow and change on a daily basis. This is part of being a unique individual in a crucial pathway of growing up. We respect that, and we do our very best to foster and encourage this individuality within every child.
                <br>
                <br>
                On our routine, we see these changes and create learning moments with each child that are based on these naturally occurring curiosities. We strive to remain flexible, and to continue to encourage a style of learning that is not forced, regimented or disciplined but is open, creative, supportive and natural.

                Working with children is a great pleasure for me, specially when I see the results. They are very smart and learn very fast making me proud to see it. I was fortunate enough to work with children since I arrived in Toronto as a babysiter. In the meantime, my passion for working with children became stronger, until I decided to make it into a career.

                I have always enjoyed being with children, planning various activities to help them learn and grow. I like children to be as independent as possible but yet I still enjoy helping them out whenever they need help.

                I am certified in CPR and in First Aid, and I have been working with children for many years. My love for children, patience and understanding their special needs will help me to become their best friend.
